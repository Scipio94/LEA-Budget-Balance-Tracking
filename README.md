Data extraction, cleaning, and manipulation from a PDF using the tabula-py package

The tabula-py package is a wrapper of [tabula-java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java) and requires java on your machine. I recommend installing [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/22/) and setting the JAVA_HOME and PATH enivronment variables in python using the os package which creates an instance of the JAVA_HOME and PATH variables. For a more permanent instance set the environment variables in the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac)
